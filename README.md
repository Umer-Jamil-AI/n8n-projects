# n8n Automation & Orchestration Portfolio

## 📖 Overview

This repository serves as a centralized portfolio of **n8n (Nodemation)** workflows designed to solve complex business logic, automate data pipelines, and orchestrate cross-platform integrations.

The workflows contained herein demonstrate proficiency in **low-code automation**, **API interoperability**, and **backend logic design**. Each JSON file represents a standalone production-grade workflow or a proof-of-concept module capable of being imported directly into an n8n instance.

## 🛠 Technical Competencies

The projects in this repository highlight the following technical capabilities:

* **Advanced ETL Operations:** Extracting, transforming, and loading data across heterogeneous systems (SQL, NoSQL, Google Sheets, CRMs).
* **API Integration:** Handling REST/GraphQL endpoints, managing authentication (OAuth2, API Keys), and processing webhooks.
* **AI Agent Deployment:** Integrating LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic) for semantic analysis, content generation, and decision-making logic.
* **Error Handling & Logic:** Implementing conditional execution (Switch/If nodes), error triggers, and retry policies for resilient automation.
* **Data Serialization:** Complex manipulation of JSON binary data and schema validation.

* ## 🚀 Deployment & Usage

To utilize these workflows in your own environment:

1.  **Import:** Download the target `.json` file and import it directly into your n8n instance via the **"Import from File"** feature in the workflow menu.
2.  **Configuration:** Update the credential nodes (e.g., API keys, database connections) to match your local environment variables.
3.  **Validation:** Review the specific node parameters and execute a test run before activating the workflow in a production environment.
